# GenHybridMLLmodel
Generalized hybrid model for mode-locked laser diodes with an extended passive cavity 

This hybrid simulation strategy combines a traveling-wave model for the semiconductor sections with a split-step Fourier implementation of the extended nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation for the extended passive cavity. Compared to our first demonstration (https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89508-6), this generalized hybrid model now includes distributed gain dispersion and offers a wider range of applicability, including pulsed regimes with nonvanishing backgrounds.
